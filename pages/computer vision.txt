Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. This involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to analyze and process images and videos in a manner similar to human vision.<br><br>Computer vision systems use digital images and videos as input, and then extract useful information from them such as object recognition, scene understanding, motion analysis, and image reconstruction. These systems can be applied to a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.<br><br>The technology behind computer vision involves a combination of techniques from computer science, mathematics, and engineering. These techniques include image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. By utilizing these methods, computer vision systems can learn from large datasets of images and videos to improve their accuracy and performance over time.<br><br>Overall, computer vision is a rapidly growing field with a wide range of applications and potential benefits. As technology continues to advance, computer vision systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and capable of performing complex tasks that were once only possible for humans.
