Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data by mimicking the way that neurons in the human brain communicate with each other.<br><br>A neural network is made up of layers of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that process and transmit information through a series of mathematical operations. The input layer receives data, which is then passed through one or more hidden layers where the computations take place, and finally to an output layer where the network produces its prediction.<br><br>Each connection between nodes in a neural network has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. During the training process, the network adjusts these weights based on the error between its predictions and the actual target values in the training data. This process is known as backpropagation, where the network iteratively updates the weights to minimize the prediction error.<br><br>Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data, making them well-suited for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. They have been successfully applied in many fields, including healthcare, finance, and marketing, and have revolutionized the way we approach problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
